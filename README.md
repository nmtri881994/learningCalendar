## Description
This project are programmed by ReactJS, Redux and little JQuery based on the APIs and Websockets provided by [learningCalendarBackend](https://github.com/nmtri881994/learningCalendar).

The most special function of this application is automatically generating learing calendar for university/college using Genetic Algorithm.
You can find the fully explanation and result of the way I apply Genetic Algorithm at [here](https://github.com/nmtri881994/Genetic-Algorithm-apply-on-generating-learning-calendar).

## Deployment
1. Open the command line under project folder and type `npm start`.
2. Open [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/).
3. Use the system with these accounts:
* Student 1: 102120160/102120160,
* Student 2: 102120161/102120161,
* Teacher: 1/1,
* Teaching and Study Management Department employee: 111111/123456.

## Note
The code maybe something mixed by Vietnamese and English.
I'm so sorry if that give you confusion, specially for those who don't know Vietnamese.
